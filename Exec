Intial scan shows ports 139,445,22, and 80

Visiting 80 gives us the default Apache splash page




Checking dirbuster yields nothing. So I looked through the SMB scan from autorecon.

Theres a server shared dir and we have write access!



I used smbclient to connect to the share

smbclient //192.168.1.74/server 

Looking at the contents shows that this is the web root!



Lets upload a php reverse shell and see what we get.

I use the PHP reverse shell from pentestmonkey but you can take your pick.

I make my changes to shell.php



Then upload with smbclient



Start a listener (I prefer penelope, but NC will do if you prefer.



I started my listener, visited the page in the browser, and got a shell.


First thing I do is check sudo -l



A user named s3cur4 can run /usr/bin/bash with sudo, we just need to become s3cur4.

Well this is easy. We issue the command:

sudo -u s3cur4 /usr/bin/bash

We are now s3cur4



cd into s3cur4's home dir and the user.txt is there



Checking sudo -l again shows that s3cur4 can run /usr/bin/apt as root. So lets take a look at GTFOBins



Search for apt and you will see that there is a entry for sudo



Clicking sudo takes us to the info




So we issue the command:

sudo apt changelog apt
!/bin/sh

Apt will do its thing and when complete, we are dropped a sh shell.



Checking the user with id shows that we are now root.



Thats it!
